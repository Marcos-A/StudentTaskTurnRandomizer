# StudentTaskTurnRandomizer
Random assignment of tasks and turns for students

To assign tasks and turns randomly, run from folder as: python StudentTaskRandomizer.py
Alternatively you can add 'task' or 'turn' when running to limit the assignment, e.g:

    - to assign only tasks, run: python StudentTaskRandomizer.py task
    - to assign only turns, run: python StudentTaskRandomizer.py turn
    
Number of tasks and students per turn ratio can be changed from the constants in the code itself.
